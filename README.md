# Hey there! I'm Jonas 👋

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** based in **Algeria**, currently obsessed with building **AI-powered web apps** and designing smooth, responsive user experiences.

If I imagine something — I *build it*.  
Web apps, automation scripts, APIs, mobile apps — if it's code, I’m probably tinkering with it.

**Frontend:**  
React • Next.js • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS • Framer Motion
